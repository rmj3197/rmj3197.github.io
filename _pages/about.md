<div style="text-align: justify"> Dr. Marianthi Markatou is SUNY Distinguished Professor and Associate Chair of Research and Healthcare Informatics, Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health and Health Professions. She also holds a joint appointment with the Jacobs School of Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, and an Adjunct Professorship in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo.  Dr. Markatou received a Ph. D. in Statistics from the Pennsylvania State University in 1988. Her research interests are broad and include problems at the interface of statistics and machine learning, modeling, mixture models, robustness, theory and applications of statistical distances, surveillance methods, emerging safety sciences, biomedical informatics and statistical methods for the analysis of massive (big) data such as Electronic Health Record data, text mining, and clustering methods for mixed-type data. Her publications appear in top journals of both Statistical Science (e.g. Journal of the American Statistical Association, Annals of Statistics, Journal of Multivariate Analysis, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, International Statistical Review, TEST, Statistics in Medicine, Statistica Sinica and many others), and Computer Science ( e.g. Journal of Machine Learning Research, Machine Learning), as well as in top medical and biomedical informatics journals ( e.g. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, Hepatology, PLOsOne and many others). Since 1990, her research work is, continuously funded, by NSF, NIH, FDA, PCORI and other non-profit organizations and research foundations.\\<br/>


Dr. Markatou is an Elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association, Elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute. Other honors include an A-level research award from IBM (2011), a Fulbright fellowship award (2017, 2019), an outstanding achievement award from the National Science Foundation (2002) and a Senior Researcher of the Year award (2019) from the School of Public Health & Health Professions, University at Buffalo.\\<br/>
